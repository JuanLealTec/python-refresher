# 12. Final Challenge

Welcome to the last stage of your Python refresher! This challenge brings together everything you have practiced so far: variables, user input, conditionals, loops, and a bit of creative thinking.

You will complete the activity directly in Google Colab, using the notebook provided below.

## 🧭 Context: Haven-42, The Last Safe Dome

After the Great Zombie Misunderstanding™, the world is... mostly fine. Humans and semi-polite zombies coexist with only the occasional "Was that a greeting or a groan?" confusion.

You are the new Intake Officer at Haven-42. Your job:

- Talk to incoming survivors.
- Evaluate their answers.
- Decide: Admit, Quarantine, or Reject.

Use your Python logic to keep things (relatively) under control.

## 💡 Tips Before You Begin

- Run the notebook top to bottom.
- Test your code often - small steps help.
- The story is light and fictional; don't overthink it.
- Use your logic; creativity is a plus.

## 🎯 What You Will Practice

- Using `input()`.
- Making decisions with `if / elif / else`.
- Combining conditions with Boolean logic.
- Handling multiple cases with loops.
- Structuring clear output.

## 📘 Learning Goal

By completing this challenge, you should feel confident combining all your core Python skills into one coherent program - readable, logical, and fun to build.

Good luck - and keep Haven-42 safe!
