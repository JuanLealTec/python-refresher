# Google Colab - Beginner Guide

If this is your first time using **Google Colab**, follow these steps.

## 1. Make your own copy (IMPORTANT)

As soon as the notebook opens, go to:

**File → Save a copy in Drive**

This creates *your own* version of the notebook. You will be the owner of the copy and you can edit and run everything safely.

## 2. Understanding cells

A notebook is made of blocks called cells:

- Text cells - explanations and instructions
- Code cells - gray boxes with Python code

Each cell can be edited or executed independently.

## 3. Running code

To run a code cell:

- Click on the cell  
- Press **Shift + Enter**, or  
- Click the ▶️ icon on the left side  

Always run cells from top to bottom, since some cells depend on earlier ones.

## 4. Editing code

Some code cells are designed for you to modify as part of the exercise. In those cells, you may:

- type code where indicated
- modify existing lines
- experiment by changing values

If something doesn't work, don't worry - that's part of the learning process.

## 5. Restarting the notebook (if something breaks)

If execution order gets mixed up or a variable becomes incorrect, you can reset everything:

**Runtime → Restart session**

Then run the cells again from the top.

## 6. Safety note about permissions

Sometimes you may see a Google message: **"This notebook was not authored by Google."**

This is a generic Colab warning for notebooks created by users - it does not mean the notebook is unsafe.

Safety checklist:

- Prefer to **File → Save a copy in Drive** before running (recommended).  
- Do not run cells that request Google Drive access (e.g., `drive.mount(...)`) unless you understand why.  

If unsure, save a copy and ask.

## You're ready!

After saving your own copy, running cells in order, and knowing how to restart, you can now use the Colab notebook safely and confidently.
