## Executive Summary

This resource helps students entering **Computational Thinking II** strengthen the key concepts learned in **Computational Thinking I**.

## Purpose

This resource is designed for self-paced study. It provides concise explanations, examples, practice exercises, Python Shorts (brief video micro-lessons), and interactive Google Colab notebooks. The ultimate goal is to strengthen your foundational knowledge to support your success in **Computational Thinking II**.

For guidance on efficient use of Colab, please consult the "Google Colab - Beginner Guide" under the Resources section in the navigation bar.

## Roadmap of Topics

For an effective review, we suggest following the logical order of the modules. This site covers:

1. [Computational Thinking](01_principles.md): Core ideas of computational problem-solving.  
2. [Input-Process-Output](02_ipo.md): The fundamental structure of any program.  
3. [Algorithms](03_algorithms.md): The design of precise, step-by-step instructions.  
4. [Variables & Constants](04_variables.md): How to store and manipulate data.  
5. [Data Types](05_data_types.md): Understanding fundamental data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`) and type casting.  
6. [Arithmetic Operators](06_arithmetic.md): Using Python’s arithmetic operators, precedence, and expressions.  
7. [Conditionals & Relational Operators](07_conditionals.md): Using `if` and `else` to make decisions in code.  
8. [Nested & Multiple Conditionals](08_nested_multiple_conditionals.md): Building complex decisions with `elif` and nested conditions.  
9. [Compound Conditions](09_compound_conditions.md): Combining conditions with `and`, `or`, and `not` for powerful decision logic.
10. [While Loop](10_while_loop.md): Repeating code blocks as long as a condition remains `True`, primarily for unknown repetitions.
11. [For Loop](11_for_loop.md): Repeating code blocks a specific number of times or iterating over a sequence, primarily for known repetitions.
12. [Final Challenge](12_final_challenge.md): A cumulative, hands-on exercise integrating key concepts from the entire refresher.
